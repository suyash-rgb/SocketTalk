feat: Implement real-time chat functionality with WebSocket and STOMP protocol

✅ Backend:
- Added WebSocketConfig.java to configure STOMP over SockJS
  - Registered endpoint at `/chat` with allowed origin `http://localhost:8030`
  - Enabled simple broker on `/topic` and set application destination prefix `/app`
- Created ChatController.java
  - Mapped `/sendMessage` to broadcast messages to `/topic/messages`
  - Added HTTP GET mapping for `/chat` view
- Defined ChatMessage.java model with fields: `id`, `sender`, `content`
  - Used Lombok annotations for boilerplate reduction

✅ Frontend:
- Built responsive Telegram-inspired chat UI in `chat.html`
  - Blue theme with mobile-style layout centered on desktop
  - Inline CSS for styling chat bubbles, header, input field, and participant sidebar
- Integrated SockJS and STOMP.js for WebSocket communication
  - Connected to `/ws` endpoint and subscribed to `/topic/messages`
  - Sent messages to `/app/sendMessage` with sender and content
- Prompted user for name on page load and used it as message sender
- Displayed messages with dynamic alignment:
  - "You" for local user messages (right-aligned)
  - Sender name for others (left-aligned)
- Tracked active participants locally and displayed them in sidebar
- Added Enter key listener to input field for quick message sending

🧪 Tested with multiple browser instances to verify real-time sync and UI alignment
